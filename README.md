# Project Title Goes Here

To run the program, you just need to run Java first,  access the SeaBattleGame class, and run the main function.

To test the program, you need to try the followings:
1. Test the youWin and youLose functions.
QuickTest: You can enter a fixed coordinate and press shoot continuously to a fixed location in the opponent board to quickly check if it works on the player board (the above one).
2. Test to see if it generates a boat in a random new position every time we replay. You can run and rerun the program many times to check.
3. Test to see if the 2D array and Map are working correctly. We have a ready print function for both the 2D display and the Map. You can uncomment to check. Every time you shoot, you can test the operation and logic behind them (the maze and shootCoordinate)
4. Check if the shoot is correct with the number you entered. You can directly check it quickly by entering a random coordinate, then check a newly shooted square coordinate using the 2 numerical labels for the row and column of the opponent's board.
